# Dog-Breed-Prediction-Project
### Quick Description:
Finding the dog breed through processing images using machine learning

## Introduction
For this app, I will be experimenting with Keras and Tensorflow to train and build a neural network that will identify the breed of the dog in an input image with an acceptable accuracy. 

This problem will be solved using the fundamentals of supervised machine learning and multiclass classification problem. 

## Deployment:
I will also be deploying this app using Flask.
